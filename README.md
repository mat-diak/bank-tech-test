## Features:


- money can be deposited and withdrew from the account
- each transaction is saved and timestamped
- full account statement can be printed

## Approach:

I started off with drafing the ideas for the classes and their responsibilites. I started with describing the Account class and added the functions to withdraw and deposit money. Secondly, I created a Statement class that stores all transaction data and formats the incoming data from Account class. StatementFormatter is resposible for producing a table for the statement. I tried to write the code, in such way, that it allows for future changes. The formatting should be relatively easy to change.


The responsibilities are split between 4 classes:

- Account - account operations
- Statement - formats the data and adds timestamps, stores transaction history
- StatementFormatter - produces a table representation of the statement
- Validator - validates inputs for account actions, could be renamed to AccountValidator if more validators come up

The decision to structure the script, in such way, was to have a clear purpose for each component. It also accommodates for adding further functionality.

### Further extensions:

- An interface class could be introduced to operate all the classes
- StatementFormatter could be be further divided, possibly into DateFormatter, AmountFormatter or TableGenerator, however, this decision would be made when given more details how to app would develop

## Edge cases considered:

- cannot withdraw when balance insufficient
- withdraw and deposit should only accept positive numbers
